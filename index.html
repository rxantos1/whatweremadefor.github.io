    <h1>What We're Made For</h1>
    <p class="line">There’s a quiet ache in the world—have you felt it?</p>
    <p class="line">Not a shout, not a scream. Just a soft, persistent hum.</p>
    <p class="line">It hums through empty hallways after goodbye.</p>
    <p class="line">Through screens lit too late at night.</p>
    <p class="line">Through glances that say, "I’m fine," when the soul is drowning.</p>

    <p class="line">We’ve built great machines.</p>
    <p class="line">Mapped the genome, split the atom, sent voices across oceans.</p>
    <p class="line">But somehow, we forgot the simplest truth:</p>
    <p class="highlight">We were never meant to go alone.</p>

    <p class="line">Connection is not a bonus. It is not a feature.</p>
    <p class="highlight">It is what we’re made for.</p>

    <p class="line">When you held your breath waiting for someone to understand—</p>
    <p class="line">That was connection, reaching out for a bridge.</p>
    <p class="line">When you cried in a stranger’s arms after the world collapsed—</p>
    <p class="line">That was empathy, showing up before the words arrived.</p>
    <p class="line">When you stayed, when you listened, when you forgave—</p>
    <p class="highlight">That was love. Not the love they sell in songs, but the love that saves.</p>

    <p class="line">We don’t sell this. We remember it.</p>
    <p class="line">We speak it in quiet voices, across tables, across time.</p>
    <p class="line">Let this be a ripple. A message tucked into someone’s pocket.</p>

    <p class="final">You are not forgotten.</p>
    <p class="final">You are not alone.</p>
    <p class="final">You are still worth loving.</p>
