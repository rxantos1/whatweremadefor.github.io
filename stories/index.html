      <h2>“He Sat With Me”</h2>
      <p>I was crying in the airport after hearing the news—my father had passed. I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t want to talk. I didn’t want advice. Just space. A man sat beside me. He said nothing. He just stayed. After fifteen minutes, he stood up, nodded once, and walked away. That silence meant more than any words ever could. I never even learned his name.</p>

      <h2>“The Post-It Note”</h2>
      <p>Years ago, I had decided to end my life. On what I thought would be my last day, I found a note on my locker: “You matter more than you know.” I never found out who left it. I’m still alive today because of that one sentence. That one person who saw me.</p>
